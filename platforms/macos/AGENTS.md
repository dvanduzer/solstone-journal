# The journal app for mac: developer guide

Read this before changing anything in `platforms/macos/`. The repository's root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) governs the native runtime; this package is the Swift adapter around it. Start with [README.md](README.md) for the shape of the package.

## Ground rules

- **The app never writes what the journal holds.** Setup, first run (`/init`), and every journal write belong to the native runtime. The Swift side starts, supervises, stops and shows it; on restart it only moves stale runtime state files under `health/` aside.
- **Two roots.** This directory is the Swift package root: sources, resources, `.build`, `journal.app` and DMGs. The repository root (`../..`) is the native runtime's source and the Git identity. Resolve paths from one or the other explicitly. Tests use `journalPackageRoot()` or `#filePath`, never the working directory.
- **Shared code lives in solstone-macos.** `SolstoneCore`, `JournalMarkKit`, `SetupChrome`, `UpdateKit`, `WatchdogKit` and the test-only `MacTestSupport` come from that repository at the exact commit pinned in `Package.swift` and `Package.resolved`. Fix shared behavior there, then move the pin here. Don't copy shared code into this package. Don't depend on the solstone app's own targets.
- **Embedded runtimes are accepted bytes.** Release packaging embeds a published native archive by digest and verifies its signed manifest. Never rebuild a runtime to package a release, and never point the app at a runtime outside its bundle.
- **Installed identity is fixed.** Bundle ID `app.solstone.journal`, the update feed and its signing key, the `solstone-watchdog` helper and its `app.solstone.journal.watchdog` LaunchAgent, Developer ID team `7QCG8V4M6H`, macOS 15 or later, Apple silicon only. A change to any of these is a product decision, not a refactor.
- **Resource bundles are named by SwiftPM.** This package's app resources build as `SolstoneJournalMac_journal.bundle`, the shared mark as `solstone_JournalMarkKit.bundle`, and setup chrome as `solstone_SetupChrome.bundle`. Packaging copies them into `Contents/Resources/` (and signs them on a signed assembly); `Bundle.module` and SetupChrome find them there. An app assembled from plain `swift build -c release` output looks for its bundles beside the build host's `.build` and crashes on any other mac: use `make assemble-journal-app` or `make journal-app-dev`.

## Commands

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Debug build. |
| `make ci` | The unit gate. It resolves the pinned support checkout, then runs its `run-ci.sh` for this package: brand assets, `swift test --no-parallel`, `scripts/tests`. |
| `make ax-contract` | Regenerate `journal-ax-contract.json` from the Swift source of truth after changing accessibility identifiers, then commit it. |
| `make icons` | Regenerate `assets/icon-journal.svg` and `AppIcon.icns` from the shared mark. |
| `make integration-native` | Opt-in tier against a real native runtime (`SOLSTONE_NATIVE_RUNTIME_DIR`, the staged accepted runtime, or the installed app's). |
| `make journal-app-dev` / `make run-journal` | A local app with a runtime built from this checkout. |
| `make release-dmg-journal JOURNAL_NATIVE_ACCEPTED_VERSION=… JOURNAL_NATIVE_ACCEPTED_SHA256=… JOURNAL_NATIVE_EXPECTED_COMMIT=… JOURNAL_NATIVE_ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE=…` | Signed, notarized, stapled DMG on the signing host. |

Run `make ci` before landing a change here. Changes to the runtime adapter (`Sources/JournalRuntime/`) or to the native runtime's setup, supervision or readiness contract also take `make integration-native`.

## Tests

- Swift Testing, in `Tests/journalTests/` (the app) and `Tests/JournalRuntimeTests/` (the runtime adapter). Runtime test helpers live in `Tests/JournalRuntimeTestSupport/`; generic helpers come from `MacTestSupport`.
- Never construct the real app state or touch the real keychain in a headless test. `make ci` runs with a throwaway keychain; a raw `swift test` does not.
- The setup-event parser is held to `Tests/JournalRuntimeTests/Fixtures/native-setup-contract.json`, which `solstone-core-setup` regenerates from its own vocabulary. Don't edit it by hand.
- Test what the code does. Don't add tests that pin Makefile text, copy or design choices.
