//! Linked-journal activity sharing groundwork: which activities were time

//! that interaction.
//!
//! Matching is code wherever code is reliable — a live message exchange, a
//! focused 1:1 read, a sustained voice label — and one narrow model question
//! for a spoken name. Summaries cite source lines; code, never the model,
//! writes who did each point. Everything here only reads the journal.
